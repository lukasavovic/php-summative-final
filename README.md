# Php Cms for Blog
SAE Institute Final exam.
In this project I created a blog with a backend in Php.
Users that are not registred or logged in can only view blog posts while 
after they register and log in they can add new blog posts and categories.

Database consists of 3 tables. 

Users in which are stored information about users,
their first and last name, their password and email.

In table Categories there is category id and also category title.

In table Posts is stored post title, post text, image, author id (the id from users table), and
 category id (from table categories).
 
 After cloning or downloading this repository, you should do the 
 `composer install`.
 
 The pre made database is is folder database and it is called blogDb. 
 You can log in with admin@admin, password admin if you dont want to create a new user.
 
 You can import so you can use the cms from the start.
